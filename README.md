THE USED METHODS
-------------------
   
This software implementation is based on:

* [viscous vortex domains method, VVD method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscous_vortex_domains_method), developed under the guidance of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. [G.Ya. Dynnikova](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Дынникова,_Галина_Яковлевна) at the Institute of Mechanics of Lomonosov Moscow State University,

* the discrete vortex method, DV method, developed and advanced in the scientific school created by Doctor of Technical Sciences, Prof. [S. M. Belotserkovsky](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Белоцерковский,_Сергей_Михайлович),
	 
* the results of research by many authors published in monographs, scientific periodicals, conference proceedings and seminars,
	 
* the authors' original models and algorythms.
